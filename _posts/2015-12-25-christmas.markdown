<p> A warm greetings to everyone who would be celebrating Christmas today, I hope that you have a great time with your family and relatives today and that you may also have these time to spend time with those who you hadn't seen in a long time since this might be the last time that you see them</p>

<p> I'm also calling out the atheists out there that are still angry or disappointed towards those who believe</p>
<p> This is not the time to be a grinch, everyone is having fun while you guys are being mean; Go outside and have fun, we have a great weather</p>

<p>Again, I greet all of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year</p>
