<p>I am a 21 year-old Senior Software Engineer from the Philippines currently pursuing a Bacherlor's Degree in IT and will soon take a degree in Mathematics</p>
<p>I was introduced to programming in highschool but never really got to focus on each that much since access to information was limited at the time</p>

<p>I have a cat named "Toffee" and in love with her secondly because Coding would always be my first love</p>
<p>When not coding, I spend most of my time working out or playing sports outside my home, I also play Dota 2 and CS:GO, you can hit me up at my steam account
